import numpy as np

# TODO take word list, retrieve vectors, write to file
# TODO find cosine distances between these word vectors, plot histogram
# TODO take max distance (or 95th percentile of distances?) and grab all other vectors in that radius, write to data file
# TODO take new vector subspace and perform some sort of clustering? (should this be multidimensional or based on cosine distances?)
# TODO produce some sort of word model for the initial word list + other words in the space they enclose

# TODO test: does this work better with raw or with normalized word vectors?
